A collection of components and libraries used in the Thunderbird mobile application.

> [!WARNING]

## Components

Components in this repository are designed to be modular and reusable. Each component is
self-contained and can be used independently or in combination with other components. We use
Kotlin Multiplatform to share code across platforms, allowing us to write once and run on both
Android and iOS.

The components are in different stages of development, and some may not be fully functional yet:

- 🛠 In development: The component is being actively developed and may not be fully functional.
- 🧪 Testing: The component is being tested and may have known issues.
- ✅ Stable: The component is stable and ready for production use.
